An SMS gateway allows a computer to send or receive Short Message Service (SMS) transmissions to or from a telecommunications network. Most messages are eventually routed into the mobile phone networks. Many SMS gateways support media conversion from email and other formats.This is a great way of bypassing the high text rates charged by the network providers.
### How it works
The Gateway can convert complicated SMS protocols into more common protocols such as HTTP. This means that developers can use web-based applications to develop an independent SMS service.<br>
